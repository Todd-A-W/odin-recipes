            <h2>High Protein Yogurt Parfait!</h2>
            <p>This is a fast and easy staple food
                for me that is amazing when you're 
                prepping for the week, or as a
                convenient and relatively healthy snack.
                Regardless of how you choose to use this
                recipe it's a fantastic way to get in some 
                Protein and a much needed serving of fruit. 
                If you're aiming for an even higher 
                protein meal simply swap the yogurt and 
                granola out for one of the many high protein 
                versions available!
            </p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yogurt of your choosing. (175g)</li>
                    <li>Frozen or fresh berries. (120g)</li>
                    <li>Granola mix. (50g)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a mason jar or sealable container
                        add 175g of yogurt.</li>
                    <li>Add 120g of berries. If using frozen 
                        berries it is best to thaw and drain
                        them before adding to the yogurt to
                        avoid excess water.</li>
                    <li>Finally add 50g of your granola mix.</li>
                </ol>
